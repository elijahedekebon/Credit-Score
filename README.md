# Credit-Score
Abstract—Credit scoring is a critical tool for risk management
 in financial lending, with traditional statistical and machine
 learning models being extensively researched for years. However,
 the trend has shifted towards deep learning models due to their
 enhanced performance across various fields. Despite the superior
 performance of deep learning models, their opaque nature poses
 challenges for their adoption in credit scoring. The inability
 to understand how these models arrive at their decisions is
 problematic, especially in fields where decisions are critical, for
 example, healthcare and banking. To address these issues, we
 introduce an innovative explainable deep learning framework
 utilizing a hybrid model that combines the strengths of Multilayer
 Perceptron (MLP) and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM)
 for credit scoring. Leveraging the German Credit Dataset from
 the UCI repository, our framework integrates cutting-edge ex
planation techniques to ensure that predictions are accurate but
 also interpretable and justifiable. Experimental results demon
strate a significant enhancement in both the robustness and
 interpretability of credit scoring models, setting a new benchmark
 for transparency and reliability in the financial domain.
 Index Terms—Multi-model deep Learning, credit scoring,
 credit risk evaluation, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI),
 and predictive model transparency.
